# Encoding
## ZIP and Japananese fonts
Japanese fonts in file names can become garbled (文字化け) when decompressed using the wrong character encoding. In Windows 10, there's a setting called "Language for non-Unicode programs," which affects the character encoding used for decompressing zip files. While Many people who use Japanese may have this set to Shift JIS, others may have this set to UTF-8. Discrepencies between this can cause file names to be garbled when decompressed.

Below is how to change the settings for this:
