# Dapr - Distributed Application Runtime
## Benefit
"The Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr) provides APIs that simplify microservice connectivity. Whether your communication pattern is service to service invocation or pub/sub messaging, Dapr helps you write resilient and secured microservices. By letting Dapr’s sidecar take care of the complex challenges such as service discovery, message broker integration, encryption, observability, and secret management, you can focus on business logic and keep your code simple." - dapr.io 2022/7/7

I believe (as of 2022 July) the key word here is 'resilient'

## Disadvantage
- Ecosystem maturity: Its initial release was in October 2019, and therefore as of July 2022, tooling surrounding Dapr may or may not be sufficiently mature, and developers may or may not be sufficently knowledgeable about the Dapr usage
- Cost: Dapr itself is free, and it is licensed under the MIT License and hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/dapr
