Sequence diagrams are a great way to debug system integration issues.

The wiki feature in Azure DevOps supports drawing sequence diagrams using the mermaid syntax, but as of April 16 2021 I believe GitHub does not natively support mermaid diagrams. I've also done a quick search on whether other types of syntax for drawing sequence diagrams is supported, but I have not been able to find anything. It seems like there are suggested workaround such as browser plug-ins and displaying sequence diagrams that have been rendered by another system, but that's not what I really want.

So I believe I will be using one of the following three options for drawing sequence diagrams on GitHub documentation
- Draw sequence diagrams by hand, take a photo, and use the image
- Draw sequence diagrams in PowerPoint and then copy the image
- Draw sequence diagrams in the wiki feature of Azure DevOps and then copy the image
