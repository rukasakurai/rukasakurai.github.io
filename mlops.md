The term "MLOps" has gained in popularity since about 2019 (Worldwide) and continues to grow exponentially as of May 2022.
On the otherhand the term "Machine Learning" rose in popularity from about 2016 and started leveling out by 2018 according to Google Trends.

I assume that while achievement such a Machine Learning beating the world best Go player in 2016 made headlines and drew attention, most companies weren't able to leverage Machine Learning effectively to deliver lasting value to customers. And I assume that the challenge lied in both identifying ways that machine learning could uncover valuable insights as well as being able to operationalize it.

One challenge that companies likely faced was being able to quickly deliver and iterate on machine learning models in real customer-facing business operations. This isn't a recent issue as companies have been facing this challenge for a long time. For example researchers in  companies might be experimenting with AI/ML with tools such as MatLab, but delivering that onto production products often takes a long time. 

Internet-based services have likely been the first to be able to incorporate Machine Learning into their operations. For example, Google search, Amazon.com's recommendation engine, Facebook's News Feed, and some insurance companies. These companies have the advantage of having massive amounts of customer data, and also the software engineering capabilities to leverage it.

With software engineering tooling provided by companies such as Microsoft becoming more available, software engineering capability should become less of a blocker for companies to leverage machine learning to uncover insights. Also ethical challenges surrounding services like Facebook have uncovered risks in leveraging machine learning on user data.

Sensor data might also be an area where machine learning can play a bigger role going forward. The term IoT started growing around 2014 and leveled off around 2017 according to Google trends. The less sexy word "sensor" is continuously rising albeit slightly in popularity since around 2005.
