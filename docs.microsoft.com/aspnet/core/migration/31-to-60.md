## Context
Noticed a comment in the pipeline saying: "Info: .NET Core SDK/runtime 2.2 and 3.0 are now End of Life(EOL) and have been removed from all hosted agents. If you're using these SDK/runtimes on hosted agents, kindly upgrade to newer versions which are not EOL, or else use UseDotNet task to install the required version."
Given that .NET Core 3.1 reached end of support on December 13 2022, decided to upgrade to .NET 6.

# So did the following
Skimmed: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/31-to-60

Simply first did the following first:
- Updated the target framework in .csproj: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/31-to-60?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio-code#update-the-target-framework
- Updated the package references in .csproj: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/31-to-60?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio-code#update-package-references
- Updated the .NET version for the CI/CD pipeline

The build caused some errors, so did the following
- Updated the target framework in Test.csproj, which was .NET 5
- Updated the version of Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/asp-net-core?tabs=netcore6. This may not have been neseccary as the build error was likely caused by a spelling error
# Result
The app successfully built, and was also able to confirm view/add/edit/delete worked for the app deployed to Azure.
