# "Azure Backup" versus Backing up in Azure
"Azure Backup" is a service in Azure used to backup resources such as files and folders on-premises, Azure VMs, Azure Managed Disks, Azure File shares, etc. It does not cover backing up of more SaaS/PaaS services such as Azure DevOps and Azure SQL Database (PaaS) which are backuped up using the backup capabilities built into each service.
