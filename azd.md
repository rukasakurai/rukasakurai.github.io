Q: What is azd?
A:
- Official doc: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview
- Azure Friday: https://youtu.be/VTk-FhJyo7s

Q: What does a repository that uses azd look like?
- The core of azd is the "azure.yaml" file
- And there's also an "azure" directory with a ".env" file
- It also has an "infra" directory with Bicep files

Q: Why do we need azd, when we already have az?
A:
- The pitch includes how it makes the developer learning experience better
- but, as of 2023-04-11, I'm not convinced that this is needed, also it's still in preview
