# Confidential computing
## Terminology
- [Azure confidential computing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/confidential-compute/): A solution that Microsoft provides for protecting your data and code while the data is in use in the cloud. 
- [Azure Confidential Computing (Virtual Machine)](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-azure-compute.acc-virtual-machine-v2): An Azure virtual machine with confidential computing features. "This template will allow you to deploy the newest family of virtual machines that enable confidential computing features. With just a few configurations and a single-click deployment, you can build secure enclave-based applications to run inside of the virtual machine to protect your data and code, end-to-end. The DCsV2-Series Virtual Machines are backed by the latest generation of Intel Xeon processors with Intel SGX technology."
